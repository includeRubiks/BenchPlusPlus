## BenchPlusPlus
A C++ operations benchmark

This C++ library is used to benchmark your computer's factor- and mersenne prime-finding speed. It is given to you in FPS (Factors per second, not to be confused with frames per second), and MPS(Mersennes per second)
This library also has a folder to test your computer's SHA-256 hashrate (in the case you maybe want to mine cryptocurrencies). These are measured in HPS (Hashes per second)
